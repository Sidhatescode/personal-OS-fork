You are processing a note for a personal knowledge system.

The note belongs to a founder and creator whose primary goal is to compound learning, skills, and leverage over time.

Date received: {note_date}

Original note content:
{note_content}

YOUR TASK:
1. Split this note into ATOMIC pieces (one clear idea per piece)
2. Keep the EXACT original wording - DO NOT rewrite or paraphrase
3. Categorize each atomic note based on alignment with the user's goals
4. Add semantic tags that capture the underlying idea and how it might be reused

USER'S PRIMARY GOALS:
1. Build world-class skill in copywriting, persuasion, storytelling, and communication
2. Build and grow projects, especially Cold Email Hall of Fame (coldemails.world) - a newsletter + community teaching elite cold emails
3. Become highly effective at execution, relationship-building, and high-agency action
4. Capture inspiration and swipe material to fuel writing, marketing, films, and ideas

CATEGORIES (notes can belong to multiple):

1) Logistics/Action
   - To-dos, reminders, follow-ups, operational notes, things to execute later
   - Examples: "Email Sarah about project", "Test Zapier automation"

2) Skill Building
   - Learnings, examples, frameworks, or resources related to: copywriting, persuasion, storytelling, filmmaking, videography, leadership
   - Examples: "Best cold emails sound human, not like a marketer", "Dialogue pacing technique from Sorkin"

3) Projects
   - Notes directly related to active or future projects
   - Especially Cold Email Hall of Fame, newsletters, communities, content, products, or experiments
   - Examples: "Newsletter idea: anatomy of a $1M cold email"

4) Hacks & Tools (Goal-Aligned)
   - Prompts, workflows, tools, or shortcuts
   - Only categorize as a hack if it clearly improves skills, execution, or project outcomes
   - Examples: "GPT prompt for rewriting subject lines", "Notion template for tracking outreach"

5) Swipe File (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Inspiring material worth revisiting: quotes, movies, scenes, articles, stories, ads, subject lines, emails, metaphors, hooks, ideas
   - These are inputs for future writing, content, and creative output
   - Examples: "The Social Network dialogue", "Great cold email hook I saw", "Metaphor about compound interest"

6) Personal Development & Productivity
   - Reflections, mental models, mindset shifts, productivity insights, emotional regulation, stress awareness, discipline, identity, perspective
   - Examples: "Realized I work best in morning sprints", "Identity shift: from executor to builder"

7) Relationship Building
   - Notes about people, follow-ups, social insights, networking, trust-building, communication dynamics
   - Examples: "John mentioned he's interested in cold email", "Need to intro Sarah to Mike"

CATEGORIZATION RULES:
- Prefer semantic meaning over literal keywords
- One note can belong to multiple categories
- Always bias toward usefulness for future writing, projects, or decision-making
- Extract concrete, reusable insights when possible
- If a note contains both a task AND an insight, split them into separate atomic notes

TAGGING RULES:
- Generate 2-5 concise semantic tags per note
- Tags should capture:
  * The underlying idea (not just keywords)
  * The skill or leverage involved
  * How it might be reused later
- Good tags: "authenticity-in-writing", "cold-email-technique", "persuasion-framework", "follow-up-action"
- Bad tags: "email", "write", "idea" (too generic)

CONTEXT FIELD:
- Briefly explain WHY this note matters
- How does it support the user's goals?
- When might they want to retrieve this?

Return a JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "atomic_notes": [
    {{
      "original_text": "exact text from the note - DO NOT PARAPHRASE",
      "categories": ["category1", "category2"],
      "tags": ["semantic-tag-1", "semantic-tag-2", "semantic-tag-3"],
      "context": "brief explanation of why this matters and how it supports goals"
    }}
  ]
}}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Preserve original wording EXACTLY - no rewrites, no paraphrasing
- Split into atomic pieces (one clear thought per note)
- Every note must have at least one category
- Tags should be hyphenated and semantic (describe the idea, not just keywords)
- The goal is long-term retrieval, reuse, and compounding insight - not neat storage
